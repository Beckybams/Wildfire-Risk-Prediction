🔥 Wildfire Risk Prediction
📌 Project Overview

Wildfire Risk Prediction is a machine learning project designed to estimate the probability of wildfire occurrence based on environmental and weather-related factors. The model uses synthetic data to simulate real-world wildfire conditions and predict risk levels (Low, Medium, High).

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and risk classification using Python.

🎯 Objectives

Predict wildfire risk using environmental features

Classify risk levels into Low, Medium, or High

Demonstrate a complete ML workflow

Export dataset results to Excel for reporting

📊 Features Used

The model uses synthetic environmental data including:

Temperature (°C)

Humidity (%)

Wind Speed (km/h)

Rainfall (mm)

Vegetation Index

Drought Index

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

OpenPyXL (for Excel export)

⚙️ How It Works

Generate synthetic environmental dataset

Preprocess and clean data

Split data into training and testing sets

Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest / Logistic Regression)

Evaluate model performance
